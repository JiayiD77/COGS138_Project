    "Electroencephalogrpahy (EEG) is a very useful tool for gathering neural data in that it is fast, cheap, and importantly non-ivasive. We are interested in their usefulness in diagnosing psychiatric ilnesses and disorders. There has been a lot of research into this field <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1), and some have shown that EEG data has a lower rate of detecting abnormalities, however we believe that because of the ease of use and gathering compared to other neural data types, we think that using EEG data can still be a valuable input when diagnosing these disorders. Of note, there have been a few succesful uses of EEG data in terms of diagnosing certan psychiatric disorders, such as distinguishing between Alzheimer's and dementia. We hope to do something similar in our exploration and try to find a useful application of EEG data for other types of pyschiatric illnesses and disorders.\n",

    "Another interesting application in this area is that some researchers have used EEG data to see if they can detect early stages of epilepsy <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#cite_note-2), and while it isn't always a specific test, EEG can still be useful for determining when more extensive testing is needed.\n",
